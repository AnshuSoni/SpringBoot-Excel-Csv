# SpringBoot Export Excel, CsSV and PDF.

Well, This is a very simple Project that showcase Export Excel (using AbstractXlsView), Csv (By extending AbstractView) and PDF. 

This project favor extentions (xls/csv/pdf)to resolve view.

I'm using:

- iText for PDF generation (AGPL licence. From iText page: "As soon as you want to use iText in a closed source, proprietary environment, you have to purchase an iText commercial license of one of the types discussed above.")
- Apache POI for Excel generation
- Super CSV for CSV generation
